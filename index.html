        Dear Alyvia,<br><br>
            Happy Birthday! You are everything to me.
            I love you so much.
            These past three months with you have been amazing.
            You never fail to put a smile on my face, and your beauty never ceases to amaze me.
            You are kind, funny, smart, thoughtful, likeable, and you make me a better person.
            I am always thinking about you.
            I hope you have the most amazing day, because you deserve it!
            Every second I am away from you I miss you.
            I look forward to so many more birthdays together!
            I mean every word in this song, and I really hope you like it.<br><br>
            I love you,<br>
            Peyton
